"""Short (<=max_seconds) ACT skill that replaces FINE_SERVO+DESCEND+GRASP.

Per the design doc: free-space motion stays with IK/Legacy, and only the
contact-rich grasp is handed to a learned policy, on a HARD wall-clock
deadline. The policy's own idea of "done" is never trusted - after the
deadline this closes the gripper and verifies with the existing
gripper.is_grasp_success(), exactly like descend_and_grasp() does.

What is reused vs. what is glue (deliberately kept as thin as possible -
observation key ordering, normalization and ACT's temporal ensembling are
easy to get subtly wrong, and a wrong action here moves real hardware):

  reused, not reimplemented
    - lerobot.rollout.inference.sync.SyncInferenceEngine - the whole
      preprocessor -> policy.select_action -> postprocessor -> make_robot_action
      per-tick path, including autocast/inference_mode handling.
    - lerobot.policies.make_pre_post_processors / get_policy_class - loads the
      checkpoint's OWN saved normalization stats, so this can never disagree
      with how the policy was trained.
    - lerobot.datasets.aggregate_pipeline_dataset_features / create_initial_features
      + lerobot.utils.feature_utils.{combine_feature_dicts,build_dataset_frame} -
      same feature plumbing lerobot_record_home_reset.py and the rollout CLI use.
    - lerobot.rollout.context._align_state_feature_order / _resolve_action_key_order -
      private, but they are the only implementation of "make the robot's joint
      order match the checkpoint's joint order". Copying them here would be a
      second copy of a safety-relevant ordering rule; importing them means a
      fix upstream reaches this too. If they ever disappear upstream, the
      import error is loud and immediate (not a silent wrong ordering).
    - kinematics.SOArm101.send_joint_deg - so every action still goes through
      joint-limit clamping AND SOFollower's max_relative_target clamp.
    - gripper.close_gripper / gripper.is_grasp_success - unchanged verification.

  glue written here (unavoidable)
    - the wrist frame comes from `cap` (camera_hub.py publishes it; this
      process must not open the device itself - see main.py) instead of from
      robot.cameras, so it is injected into the observation dict by hand
      under the camera key the CHECKPOINT declares, and converted BGR->RGB
      (cap gives OpenCV BGR; recording via OpenCVCamera defaults to
      color_mode=RGB, so feeding BGR here would be an out-of-distribution
      input with no error message).
    - the deadline loop, the stall check, and the joint-name -> ALL_JOINTS
      array mapping for send_joint_deg.

The policy + processors are loaded once and cached module-level, keyed by
(policy_path, id(robot)): run()'s retry loop can call this up to
MAX_GRASP_ATTEMPTS times per task, and re-loading an ACT checkpoint each
attempt would add seconds of dead time between retries. Keyed by robot too
because Phase 3 runs two arms in one process.
