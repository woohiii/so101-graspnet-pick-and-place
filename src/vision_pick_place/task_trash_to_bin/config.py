"""Central config for the trash -> bin task: every tunable number in one
place, same convention as the sibling task_red_cube_to_bin_new_gripper/.

2026-09-08: trimmed copy of ../task_red_cube_to_bin_new_gripper/config.py for
the color/shape-agnostic "pick up trash, drop in bin" MVP - RIGHT ARM ONLY
(left-arm calibration still unverified, see
task_red_cube_to_bin_new_gripper/CALIBRATION_HANDOFF.md). No per-side
overrides, no HSV/shape-detector constants, no FINE_SERVO/search-sweep
tuning constants - this task has no wrist-cam closed-loop servo (no generic
detector exists for an arbitrary clicked object), so only click_grasp_trash.py's
IK-hover-then-descend-and-grasp path is supported. Everything physically
measured below (ports, TABLE_Z, GRASP_TARGET_PX, BIN_POSE_XYZ, etc.) is
carried over unchanged from the right arm's own calibration - same hardware.
