"""Gripper open/close and grasp-success verification.

Per the spec's risk note (§6): this hardware has no current/torque feedback
readable through the driver in use here, so "성공 판정이 사실상 불가"
doesn't actually apply - position feedback alone is enough. Closing on
nothing reaches (near) the same fully-closed reading every time; closing on
a real object stops well short of that, wedged against it. This was a real
false positive earlier today (a run reported success purely because descend
raised no collision, when the user watching live confirmed nothing was
grasped) - "did descend hit something" and "is something actually between
the jaws right now" are different facts, and only checking the gripper's own
final resting position answers the second one.

Wrist-cam color-presence as a second check (the spec's suggested backup) is
NOT implemented - it hasn't been validated against real hardware, and the
gripper-position check alone was enough to catch the one real false positive
seen today. Left as a clearly-marked extension point, not built speculatively.
