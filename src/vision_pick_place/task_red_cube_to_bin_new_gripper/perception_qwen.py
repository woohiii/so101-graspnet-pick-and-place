"""Local, open-vocabulary object detection via Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct - replaces
task_red_cube_to_bin/perception_zeroshot.py's Gemini cloud calls with a model
that runs on this machine's own GPU (RTX 5050, 8GB VRAM - Qwen2.5-VL-3B fits in
fp16 with room to spare). Picked over Llama-3.2-Vision because Qwen2.5-VL was
actually trained to emit bounding-box coordinates for a described object
(grounding); Llama-3.2-Vision's training is captioning/VQA-focused and has no
equivalent structured-box output.

Same Detection-shaped interface as perception_zeroshot.detect_zeroshot - a
drop-in detect_fn for any caller already built against that shape.

2026-09-01: started with Qwen2-VL-2B, real live-frame testing (a clean,
unannotated Astra frame with a black cube/small red cube/orange clip on the
table - the FIRST smoke test frame used before this had a debug HUD baked
into it by an earlier detector's own overlay, and Qwen2-VL's answers on that
one were suspiciously anchored to that baked-in text rather than the actual
object - caught only by checking a saved image directly, not trusted blindly)
showed real problems: (a) inconsistent coordinate convention call to call
(sometimes pixel-ish numbers in its own internally-resized input space,
sometimes plain 0-1 normalized fractions - see the small-value branch below),
and (b) only 1/3 objects (the large, high-contrast black cube) actually
localized correctly - the small red cube and the orange clip both came back
badly wrong. Switched to Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct (same VRAM budget, same
prompt/parsing shape) and re-ran the identical 3-object test: all 3 landed
correctly this time, AND Qwen2.5-VL's bbox_2d came back already in the
ORIGINAL frame's pixel space (confirmed by comparing to each object's real
on-screen position directly) - no image_grid_thw-based rescale needed at all,
unlike Qwen2-VL. Kept the <=1.5 branch below as a defensive fallback in case
a future prompt/model ever answers in normalized fractions instead, but the
grid_thw rescale path Qwen2-VL needed is gone - verify again if this model is
ever swapped for a different one.

    2026-09-01: a single call asking Qwen to output a bbox_2d array for
    EVERY object at once was tried first and real-frame-tested against 3
    known objects (black cube/small red cube/orange clip) - it returned []
    (nothing) on the exact prompt from this module's single-object
    _DETECT_PROMPT_TMPL adapted to a list, and even a much simpler "detect
    all objects, output a JSON array" prompt only ever found 1-2 of the 3
    and with visibly wrong boxes. Multi-object enumeration is a
    qualitatively harder task for a 3B model than "find THIS described
    object" (already confirmed 3/3 reliable - see this module's earlier
    docstring), not a fixable prompt-wording bug - re-verified by trying a
    tight crop around each object's own known location and asking Qwen to
    detect "the object nearest the center of that crop": still 2/3 failed
    (returned nothing), the crop apparently removes context the model
    needs. Given both attempts at direct multi-object grounding failed on
    real data, this instead does the two-phase thing that DOES work: (1)
    _list_object_names asks a plain "what's here" free-text question (a
    much easier task - real-frame-tested, correctly named the black cube,
    though it still missed the small red cube entirely, i.e. recall here is
    NOT complete either), then (2) each named candidate is grounded
    SEPARATELY with detect_qwen against the FULL frame - reusing the one
    path already proven reliable, rather than trusting either of the direct
    multi-object attempts. Still an incomplete solution (an object this
    step's naming pass misses never gets a box) - qwen_click_pick_place.py
    keeps a manual-description fallback for exactly that gap, don't remove
    it thinking this function got fixed.

    Also real-frame-tested with a dedup issue: _list_object_names sometimes
    names the SAME physical object more than once with different wording
    ("Black object", "White object", "Black cube" all grounded to the
    identical bbox on one real frame) - deduped below by center-distance
    (DEDUP_CENTER_PX) rather than trusting the names to be distinct."""
